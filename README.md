# Simple Clinical RAG System for Medical Guidelines

This repository provides a practical tutorial demonstrating how to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically tailored for querying medical guidelines or other healthcare documents.

**Why RAG for Healthcare?**

* **Accuracy:** Ensures Large Language Model (LLM) responses are grounded in verified medical knowledge sources provided by you.
* **Verifiability:** Provides references/citations, allowing users to trace answers back to the source document.
* **Control:** Gives you direct control over the information the LLM uses.
* **Reduced Hallucinations:** Minimizes the risk of the LLM generating plausible but incorrect information.

This project walks through setting up the necessary components, loading documents (including your own PDFs), and building a query system using LangChain and OpenAI.
